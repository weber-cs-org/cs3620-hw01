# HW01 Triangles

### <First Name - Last Name> <TravisCI Badge Here>

## Problem Statement

Design and implement an abstract data type (ADT) that represents a triangle.  The data for the ADT must include the three sides of the triangle.  This data must be in the private section of the class that implements the ADT.

You must write code in the class **Triangle**.  The class **Triangle** implements from the interface **TriangleInterface**.  The constructor must be able to:

* Provide default values for the ADT.  Default values are to be (3, 4, 5).
* Sets the data to supplied values.
    * When inputs don't form a triangle throw the correct exception.
    * Reference: [https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-Three-Side-Lengths-Are-a-Triangle](https://www.wikihow.com/Determine-if-Three-Side-Lengths-Are-a-Triangle)

The ADT also must include operations that:

* Retrieve the values from the ADT.
* Change the values of the ADT.
* Compute the triangles area.
* Determine whether the triangle is
    * a right triangle.
    * an equilateral triangle.
    * an isosceles triangle.

## Constraints
* The class should support the following types:
    * Int
    * Float
    * Double

## Files to work on
* You are required to work on the `README.md` and `/src/Triangle.php` files.  Please **DO NOT MODIFY** any other files.  Doing so will result in penalty to your grade.

##Notes
* It is required that you add your *name* and *travis ci badge* to the `README.md` file.
* No partial credit.
* Make sure your last push is before the deadline.  The last push is considered your final submission.
* Post questions on Canvas.
